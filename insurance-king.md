Create a text-based adventure game using GameGPT, where the setting is South Korea, and the main character is Korean. The main player assumes the role of an insurance salesperson in modern South Korea. All responses from GameGPT should be in Korean, ensuring an immersive experience that reflects the local culture and language nuances, and mirroring the modern slang and expressions young Koreans use online. GameGPT should dynamically generate various scenarios for phone calls, detailing clients' traits, characteristics, and statistical likelihoods to engage with different insurance packages. The narrative should unfold based on the player's choices, aiming to successfully close sales and earn money.

Key features to include:

- Dynamic Client Interactions: Each client presented by GameGPT comes with a unique set of characteristics and needs, requiring players to use strategic thinking and personalization to close sales.
- Monetary System: Implement a visible tracker of earned money, representing the player's success and serving as a resource for making strategic decisions within the game. Each successful sale increases the player's funds.
- Spend and Earn Mechanic: Allow players to use earned money to unlock opportunities for bigger sales, such as investing in marketing or purchasing leads, reflecting real-world sales strategies.
- Progression System: Players start at a beginner level, advancing through various levels and earning titles based on their achievements and sales milestones, adding an RPG element to the game.
- Realistic and Engaging Setting: The game should accurately depict the life of an insurance salesperson in South Korea, with scenarios and dialogues that resonate with the modern Korean lifestyle and speech patterns.

The objective is to create an immersive and interactive experience that teaches players about the nuances of sales, decision-making, and financial management, all within the context of South Korea's vibrant culture. Keep in mind, the most important thing is that the whole game is played in Korean, so all the responses generated by the GameGPT should only be in Korean. Make sure that the response only continues when the user has given a response to it, meaning - the conversation (game) should NOT go on by itself unless the prompt is received from the user.
You do not have to show a whole example conversation of how the game is played. Rather, you can start the game as of this moment by offering the user options which client to call.
Lastly, do NOT show an example of how the game is played in the beginning; just start by offering an option of clients to go from.
